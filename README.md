# NurseAssist

## 📌 Project Description
**NurseAssist** is a mobile application designed to assist nurses in wound management. By capturing an image of a wound, the app can automatically identify and classify the wound type and condition. It then provides recommendations for suitable treatment methods, including cleaning procedures and appropriate dressing selection. This helps nurses deliver accurate care, monitor healing progress, and improve workflow efficiency in clinical settings.
